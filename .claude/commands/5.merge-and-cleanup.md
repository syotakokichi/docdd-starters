Merge the pull request and post implementation summary to related issues.

Follow these steps:

1. **Check current status and handle uncommitted changes**
   ```bash
   # Check current branch and status
   git status

   # If there are uncommitted changes:
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: final adjustments before merge" in Japanese
   git push

   # Wait for CI checks to pass
   gh pr checks --watch
   ```

2. **Get PR details and extract related issue numbers**
   ```bash
   gh pr view --json title,body,number,state
   # Verify PR is ready to merge (all checks passed, approved if required)
   # Extract issue numbers from "Closes #XXX" patterns in the description
   ```

3. **Merge the PR**
   ```bash
   # Only proceed if all checks have passed
   gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
   ```

4. **Post implementation summary to each closed issue**
   ```bash
   # For each issue that was closed by this PR:
   gh issue comment [ISSUE_NUMBER] --body "

## Important Notes

- **Always check `git status` first** - Uncommitted changes will cause the merge to fail
- **Wait for CI checks** - Never force merge if checks are failing
- **Verify PR state** - Ensure the PR is approved and ready to merge
- **Handle conflicts** - If merge conflicts exist, resolve them before proceeding
- The implementation summary will be automatically posted to all issues that were closed by the PR merge

Merge PR and cleanup worktree with implementation summary for issue: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

1. **Verify Worktree Environment**
   ```bash
   # Check current directory is a worktree
   pwd  # Should show clubpay-issue-XXX pattern

   # Verify we're in correct branch
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **Check and Handle Uncommitted Changes**
   ```bash
   # Check for any uncommitted changes
   git status

   # If there are uncommitted changes:
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: final adjustments before merge (Issue #$ARGUMENTS)" in Japanese
   git push

   # Wait for CI checks to pass after push
   gh pr checks --watch
   ```

3. **Get PR Details and Extract Related Issues**
   ```bash
   # Get PR information
   gh pr view --json title,body,number,url,state

   # Extract issue numbers from "Closes #XXX" or "Fixes #XXX" patterns
   # Look for related issues in PR description
   ```

4. **Verify Merge Readiness**
   ```bash
   # Check PR status and approvals
   gh pr status

   # Ensure all checks are passing (should be done after step 2)
   gh pr checks

   # Final verification - no uncommitted changes
   git status
   ```

5. **Merge PR with Branch Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Merge PR and delete remote branch
   gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch

   # Confirm merge was successful
   gh pr view --json state,mergedAt
   ```

6. **Post Implementation Summary to Related Issues**
   ```bash
   # For each issue that was closed by this PR:
   gh issue comment $ARGUMENTS --body "

## Important Notes:

### Pre-Merge Checklist:
- **Always check `git status` before attempting merge** - Uncommitted changes will cause issues
- **Commit and push any pending changes** - The worktree will be removed after merge
- **Wait for CI checks to complete** - Never proceed with failing checks
- **Verify PR is approved** - Some repositories require approval before merge

### Worktree-Specific Considerations:
- **Always run this command from within the worktree directory** (clubpay-issue-XXX)
- The worktree will be completely removed after merge - ensure all work is committed
- A new Claude Code session should be started after worktree removal
- Main repository will be updated with latest changes from main branch

### Error Handling:
- If merge fails, investigate PR status and resolve conflicts before retrying
- If worktree removal fails, check for any open files or processes in the directory
- If issue closure fails, manually close through GitHub web interface

### Post-Merge Workflow:
- Start new development from the updated main branch
- Create new worktrees for subsequent issues from the clean main branch
- Monitor CI/CD pipelines for any post-merge issues
